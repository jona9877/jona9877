### I recently joined PwC as a graduate associate in the Innovation & Data (DA3 / Advanced Analytics) team within Digital Audit. Prior to joining PwC, I graduated from Imperial College Business School with a MSc Financial Technology, where I broadened my skills in programming and technology implementation for financial applications. I am passionate about leveraging data, statistical models, and machine learning to extract value to create tangible impact to the wider community.

### I see myself as a detail-oriented thinker and stand for honesty, respect and excellence. I embrace challenges and believe only challenges can lead to major breakthroughs. I am always seeking for opportunities that will allow me to achieve my goals and make a difference towards the wider community.
